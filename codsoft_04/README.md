# Task 02: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview:
This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python, offering both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a console-based version. The game prompts users to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, generates a random choice for the computer, and determines the winner based on predefined game logic. The GUI version uses Tkinter for a user-friendly interface, while the console version operates through the command line.

## Scenario:
Ideal for situations where users want to play a simple yet entertaining game, the Rock-Paper-Scissors project provides an interactive gaming experience. Users can make choices, see the computer's move, and discover the game outcome.

## Features:
- GUI version with Tkinter interface.
- Console version for command-line gaming.
- Score tracking and play again functionality.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI version)
- Random module

## Techniques Practiced:
- User input handling
- Randomization
- Game logic implementation
- GUI design and implementation (for GUI version)

## Usage:
- For the GUI version, run `gui.py` to open a graphical interface. Make your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the game result.
- For the console version, run `console.py` to play through the command line.

## Directory Explanation:
- **gui.py**: GUI implementation using Tkinter.
- **console.py**: Console-based implementation.

## Issues:
- No known issues at the moment.

## Acknowledgements:
- The project uses Tkinter for GUI, a standard Python library.
