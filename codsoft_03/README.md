# Task 01: Password Generator

## Overview:
This project implements a Password Generator in Python, offering both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a console-based version. The Password Generator allows users to create strong and random passwords with specified lengths. The GUI version is built using the Tkinter library, providing a user-friendly interface, while the console version is a simple command-line implementation.

## Scenario:
In scenarios where users require a secure and randomized password, this application provides a quick and easy solution. Users can choose the desired length of the password, and the application generates a password using a combination of random characters.

## Features:
- GUI version with Tkinter interface.
- Console version for command-line usage.
- Password generation with specified length and complexity.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI version)

## Techniques Practiced:
- User input handling
- Randomization and string manipulation
- GUI design and implementation (for GUI version)

## Usage:
- For the GUI version, run `gui.py` and input the desired password length. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a password.
- For the console version, run `console.py` and follow the instructions to input a valid password length. The generated password will be displayed in the console.

## Directory Explanation:
- **gui.py**: GUI implementation using Tkinter.
- **console.py**: Console-based implementation.

## Issues:
- No known issues at the moment.

## Acknowledgements:
- The project utilizes the Tkinter library for GUI, a standard Python library.
